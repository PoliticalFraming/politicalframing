#jQuery UI Bootstrap

This project was started to bring the beauty and ease-of-use of Twitter Bootstrap to jQuery UI widgets â™¥.

##Why?

Bootstrap is one of our favorite projects, but having used it regularly it left us wanting two things:

* The ability to work side-by-side with jQuery UI (something which caused a number of widgets to break visually)
* The ability to theme jQuery UI widgets using Bootstrap styles. Whilst we love jQuery UI, we find some of the current themes to look a little dated. Our hope is that this theme provides a decent alternative for others that feel the same.

To clarify, this project doesn't aim or intend to replace Twitter Bootstrap. It merely provides a jQuery UI-compatible theme inspired by Bootstrap's design. It also provides a version of Bootstrap CSS with a few (minor) sections commented out which enable the theme to work along-side it.

We welcome any and all feedback as we would very much like this theme to be as solid as possible.

##Browser-support

All modern browsers are targeted by this theme with 'lo-res' experiences (i.e no gradients, border-radius etc.) provided for users using older browsers. 

There *are* some minor known issues lingering that I'm working on, but the hope is that in time those will all get ironed out. 

##jQuery UI support

This theme targets jQuery UI 1.9.2 and the default version of jQuery included in the (current) jQuery UI builds (jQuery 1.6.2+).

##Project status

This project is under active, but slow development. There has been a great deal
of work done in branches to introduce compatibility with jQuery UI 1.9 and further
work done to move us towards using LESS and improved parity with Bootstrap 2.x.

At this time, we are seeking contributors interested in helping us finally complete
the work needed to be Bootstrap 2.x compatible. This would involve helping in your
spare time across a few weeks and you would be given credit in the project README.

As one of the (currently) more popular open-source jQuery UI themes we would love to
get out more frequent releases and your help with this would be greatly appreciated.
