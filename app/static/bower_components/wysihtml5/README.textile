h1. wysihtml5 0.3.0

wysihtml5 is an open source rich text editor based on HTML5 technology and the progressive-enhancement approach.
It uses a sophisticated security concept and aims to generate fully valid HTML5 markup by preventing unmaintainable tag soups and inline styles.
The code is completely library agnostic: No jQuery, Prototype or similar is required.

*This project was initiated and is supported by the "XING AG":https://www.xing.com*. Thanks!

h2. Features

* Auto linking of urls as-you-type
* Generates valid and semantic HTML5 markup (no <code><font></code>)
* Uses class-names instead of inline styles
* Unifies line-break handling across browsers (hitting enter will create <code><br></code> instead of <code><p></code> or <code><div></code>)
* Auto-parses content inserted via copy & paste (from Word, Powerpoint, PDF, other web pages, ...)
* Converts invalid or unknown html tags into valid/similar tags
* Source code view for users with HTML skills
* Uses sandboxed iframes in order to prevent identity theft through XSS
* Editor inherits styles and attributes (placeholder, autofocus, ...) from original textarea (you only have to style one element)
* Speech-input for Chrome

h2. Browser Support

The rich text editing interface is supported in IE8+, FF 3.5+, Safari 4+, Safari on iOS 5+, Opera 11+ and Chrome.
*Graceful Degradation:* Users with other browsers will see the textarea and are still able to write plain HTML by themselves.
